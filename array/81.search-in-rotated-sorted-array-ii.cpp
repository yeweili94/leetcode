 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
 * 
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true,
 * otherwise return false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * This is a follow up problem toÂ Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums
 * may contain duplicates.
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 *
